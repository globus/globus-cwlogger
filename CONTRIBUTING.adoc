Contributing to globus-cwlogger
===============================

Guidelines
----------

- Maintaining a stable client and server is our primary goal, so we favor
  carefully planned changes and slow releases

- We are conservative with the featureset we offer

- The daemon only supports one python version (currently python2, will switch
  to python3)

- The client supports both python2 and python3 until at least python2 EOL

Linting & Testing
-----------------

- No linting is currently setup, but we are considering adding `flake8`,
  `black`, and `isort` to our requirements.

- "Simulated" automated testing (e.g. with a mocked cwlogs API) is not a
  priority for this project

  - We want to test in the realistic context of a server running the daemon,
    writing to cwlogs

  - Lacking mock-based unit-tests does not reflect a lack of investment in
    testing -- enhancements to the testing tools are very much welcome!

NOTE: Please do not reformat code cosmetically without discussing it
beforehand. We do want to apply some code checkers and fixers, but as part of
a carefully considered effort.
